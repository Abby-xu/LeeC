        Idea:
        use fast / slow pointers to find the middle node and see whether the list has odd/even number of elements.
        Reverse the right half the list, and compare with the left half
        
        E.g.
        1->2->3->4->3->2->1->null
        fast = null
        slow = 4
        slow->next = 3
        reverse(slow->next)
        null<-3<-2<-1 compare with 1->2->3->â€¦

        Time complexity: O(n)
        Space complexity: O(1)
